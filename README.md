# calculator_v1
Very basic calculator. I made this challage to myself to make it from scratch, without using any tutorials or to look at other calculator projects. This is my current knowledge after 1 month of learning JavaScript. It is lacking a LOT of features like decimals, chained operations ( ie x + y - c  +v) and some small stuff.
